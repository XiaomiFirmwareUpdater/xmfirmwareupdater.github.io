After a long time of waiting for the new update, MIUI 10 Pie build 9.3.25 for Xiaomi Note 5 (whyred) was leaked today.

Surprisingly, the beta build released for both Global and China ROMs closed beta teams, and it got leaked via telegram user.

Because Xiaomi Note 5 (whyred) is a super popular device for custom ROMs users, I've made a special release of those closed beta Pie ROMs Firmware, non-arb Firmware, and Firmware-less ROMs.

**Note**: These ROMSs and Firmwares can't be flashed from the official updater. You'll have to use a custom recovery in order to flash.
