title: Announcing a new download page for MIUI 12 China Beta
categories: ROMs

Xiaomi has announced MIUI 12 recently, and many of people wants to try the new UI. But as you know, Xiaomi always release the new updates for the China beta first. Also Xiaomi is no longer providing download links on their official website.

I've been collecting the links every week in order to provide weekly firmware updates for custom roms users through my XiaomiFirmwareUpdater project, and I decided to make these links available for everyone.

The download page on my XiaomiFirmwareUpdater website has all MIUI 12 China Beta official roms starting from April 2020 for 30+ device. I'll keep it updated with newer releases every week.
