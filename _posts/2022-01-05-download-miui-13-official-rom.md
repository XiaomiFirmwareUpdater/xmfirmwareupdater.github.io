title: Announcing a new download page for MIUI 13 ROMs!
categories: ROMs

Xiaomi has announced MIUI 13 one week ago, and many of people wants to try the new UI as soon as possible. But as you know, Xiaomi always release the new updates for the China beta first, and they are no longer providing download links on their official website.

So, like we did with MIUI 13, we will be providing updates links every week in order to provide weekly firmware updates for custom roms users through XiaomiFirmwareUpdater project. The new download page on XiaomiFirmwareUpdater website will have all MIUI 13 official roms, including stable and China beta starting from January 2022 for all eligable devices. We'll keep it updated with newer releases every week.
