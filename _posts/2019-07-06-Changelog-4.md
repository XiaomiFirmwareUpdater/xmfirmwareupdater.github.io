Our last changelog was in May, during this long time many things happened in the project and Xiaomi world as well. Let's start:

<hr/>

### No More Global Beta
Xiaomi has decided to end the public beta program for all Global devices, including the devices that don't have a Chinese variant like Pocophone F1 and Redmi Note 6 Pro. This is sad news for Xiaomi community, as many users have been using the weekly ROMs for a long time. 

Also, this means there'll be no Global firmware updates by us :( Please switch to latest Global Stable firmware for your device once a new update comes out. If you have a Chinese device or don't have a problem with using Chinese firmware on your global device, you can flash weekly china firmware which will continue to release.

<hr/>

### MIUI Public Downloads Scraper
I have written another handy script that scraps Xiaomi MIUI ROM links from downloads website and generates JSON files. And as usual, it's written in python3, means it works on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.

Check the new tool [here](https://github.com/XiaomiFirmwareUpdater/miui-downloads). And feel free to contribute to the [code](https://github.com/XiaomiFirmwareUpdater/miui-downloads).

### MIUI Stable ROMs Archive
Imagine having all MIUI Stable ROMs downloads of every single Xiaomi device in one place!
That's what I tried to do some days ago, and here's the output: A giant archive of all MIUI Stable ROMs for all devices in JSON files. Available as separated files for each codename and as one merged file for all devices.

Check it out now! [Here](https://github.com/XiaomiFirmwareUpdater/miui-stable-archive). And feel free to report any issues or missing devices, it's still beta :D

A front end of these files will be added to the website later.
