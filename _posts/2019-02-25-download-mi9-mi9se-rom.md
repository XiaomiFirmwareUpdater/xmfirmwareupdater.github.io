The new flagship by Xiaomi, Mi 9 and its 'lite' version have been released earlier this week, and we saw a good move from Xiaomi by released the kernel source immediately after the launch event, but stock ROM took some time.

Mi 9 series has three devices for now, the most-powerful flagship Mi 9 (codename: *cepheus*), the pretty Mi 9 Transparent Edition, and the first device with Snapdragon 712 in the world Mi 9 SE (codename: *grus*)

We, at Xiaomi Firmware Updater, was able to get the first official MIUI package for Mi 9 and Mi 9 SE, although it's not available on MIUI China website yet!

Mi 9 MIUI version is *V10.2.5.0*, while Mi 9 SE one is *V10.2.3.0*, and both of them are running Android Pie (9.0) unlike [some leaks](https://gagadget.com/xiaomi-mi-9/43989-xioami-mi-9-poyavilsya-na-zhivyih-izobrazheniyah-s-trojnoj-osnovnoj-kameroj/) reported earlier.
