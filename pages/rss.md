            <p>News feeds allow you to see when websites have added new content. You can get the latest updates in one
                place, as soon as it's published, without having to visit the websites you have taken the feed from.</p>
            <p>Feeds are generally known as RSS (Really Simple Syndication) which are just web pages, designed to be
                read by computers rather than people.</p>
